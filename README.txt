Dijkstra Routing Example

Run code with 

make clean
make all
./Dijkstra LSInput.txt

Supplying no input file defaults to the test input provided in the proejct document

Code should output the correctr table, although your terminal window should
stretch fairly wide to accomodate.

This hodgepodge of slopped together C code is the result of not quite knowing how
to represent a node as a structure and how to process them. Eventually I got it
working but I'm sure theres a handful of functions and code I could safely delete.
Maybe one day. For now it works.
